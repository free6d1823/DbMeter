Lack alert sound sound I would have to spend some warning sound level because I need it for my job of teaching


Pretty good Pretty correct the measured levels. Very wise idea spectrometer, but would lack save the measurement and expand the frequency range to be measured


Great One detail: it would be great to have a button to stop playing when you want and have a record for reference. Thank you!

A nice app. Pros 1) Shows peak and average readings. 2) Displays frequency of the sound. Cons 1) Ads 2) No calibration button Desirable 1) To allow logging to a text file which can be transferred Clarification needed 1) The difference between peak and max values shown All in all: a good app.
